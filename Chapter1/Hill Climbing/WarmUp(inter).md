Let’s work with the acceptance probability above exp(–(S_old – S_new)/T).  

Suppose our our current solution has a score of S_old = 205. Our new solution would have a score of S_new = 196

Using simulated annealing, there is a possibility for us to accept this new state even though it has a lower score than the current one.

In this situation, what would the temperature T need to be in order to choose this new state with a probability of at least 0.5?

Select the correct answer

 - [] 0.5
 - [] 0.4 
 - [X] 13
